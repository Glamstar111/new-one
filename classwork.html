        <p>In the world of content marketing, few things get as much attention (both good and bad) as search engine optimization. While most bloggers and small business owners recognize the value of optimizing their content for search performance, the cost of many SEO tools can be prohibitive.
            
            Luckily, there are also many great opportunities to do SEO audits and keyword research for free!
            
            One such opportunity is the use of Google Search Console for keyword research. Not only is it a budget-friendly solution, but you are accessing the information straight from the source. After all, data shows that Google currently has 90.63% of the search engine market share. In terms of building organic search traffic, they are your golden ticket.  
            
            To help you get started, we will break down what Google Search Console is, what information it can provide you, and how to leverage this data to boost your SEO efforts.

            <p>As pet parents and small business owners, we all know how incredible and exciting the pet industry is. New and innovative ideas inspire us as they come to market, brands regularly update and improve upon existing products, and the industry continues to grow year after year. In fact, according to the American Pet Products Association (APPA), the pet industry is expected to reach $143.6 billion in sales in the U.S. this year alone!
                
                With so much happening, staying on top of all the changes and developments can be challenging. Luckily for us, industry events like SuperZoo bring us all together.
                
                With over 20,000 pet professionals in attendance and 1,100+ exhibitors, SuperZoo is touted as North America’s largest pet retail event. The website states, “It’s the ultimate destination for pet pros to get business done (while having some fun)! Stock up, scale up and catch up with peers and suppliers in the most comprehensive marketplace of debut products, proven best-sellers and management and e-commerce solutions that can drive your business forward.”
                
                This year, two members of the BlogPaws team (Britt and Jessica) attended the show, scouring the tradeshow floor to find the most innovative, impressive, and show-stopping brands, products, and displays. After 3 busy days at the show and some long conversations back home, the team has awarded a total of 27 BlogPaws Best Awards to the brands we felt were making a significant impact in the pet industry.
